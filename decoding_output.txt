apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding regarding the expectation of the encoded file size. In the LZW compression algorithm, the encoded file size may not always be smaller than the original file size, especially for small input files or inputs with limited repetitive patterns.
The LZW compression algorithm works by creating a dictionary of frequently occurring patterns and replacing them with shorter codes. However, if the input data doesn't contain many repetitive patterns or if the dictionary becomes too large, the compressed file size may be larger than the original file size due to the additional codes and dictionary overhead.
If you're specifically looking for a compression algorithm that consistently reduces the file size, you may consider other compression techniques such as Huffman coding or Deflate compression (which combines LZ77 and Huffman coding). These algorithms are widely used in various file compression utilities and can typically achieve smaller compressed file sizes compared to simple LZW compression. apologize for the confusion.
