# DSA Project
Multimodal compression for lossy compression of image files, and lossless compression of audio and text files.

Instructions for using the software: 
1) compile all C files by doing cc *.c
2) while executing the executable file(./a.out), add the file name in the command line itself.
for eg ./a.out img.bmp 
./a.out aud.wav 
./a.out data.txt

Please make sure that the file extension is correct .bmp for image, .wav for audio, and .txt for text file.
